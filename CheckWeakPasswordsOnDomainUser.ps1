Explain :

This script checks for weak passwords on domain user accounts by querying the password policy settings 
on your organization's domain controllers and comparing them to the settings on each user's account.
You can modify this script to add additional checks for misconfigured security settings based on your specific requirements.

MORE!

This script should be run in a server environment that has the Active Directory PowerShell module installed, 
as it queries Active Directory for user account information. Additionally,the script should be run with administrative
 privileges to ensure that it has the necessary permissions to access and modify system settings.

 Typically, only domain administrators and IT support staff with appropriate privileges should be allowed to run this
  script. Other users or groups may not have the necessary permissions to access and modify the required settings, 
  which could potentially cause unintended consequences.
